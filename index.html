                        <h3>Mediatonic Games <small>Jan 2017 - Present</small></h3>
                        <p>Part of a large team of dedicated C# engineers responsible for implementing features on a range of primarily mobile focused games that attract millions of monthly players.</p>
                        <p>A typical day consists of a morning stand up; time spent reviewing comments on any open PRs; and feature work, mostly involving server-side C# but also including some Angular.js based admin functionality.</p>
                        <p>As part of this position I have become familiar with technologies such as Kubernetes; Docker; and .NET Core. I've also become comfortable working in an entirely Windows based development environment.</p>

                        <p>For most of my time at Graphite I was the lead engineer on Costa's loyalty platform API, working closely with a senior architect and the mobile teams to deliver a new "Pay &amp; Collect" feature, working to deadlines along the
                            way.

                        <p>Most recently I worked with a small team to build a new sales incentive platform. We had a month to plan, build, test, and deliver an MVP product. It featured a Laravel API with a Vue.js powered browser client, plus a simple admin
                            panel to manage the various campaigns. I helped manage and prioritise the task backlog in order to ensure we met the tight deadline.</p>

                        <p class="page-break-after">I was also responsible for configuring and maintaining Apache hosting spaces on shared and VPS hosting platforms, as well as deploying sites and monitoring their health.</p>
                        <p>As the development team grew I implemented processes to ensure mistakes weren't made during the development and deployment phases, such as a gulpfile for automating tedious build steps.</p>

                            like sliders, overlays, and tooltips. It also used techniques such as background videos.</p>
