                    <p>Full stack developer with three years experience building sites using HMTL; Scss; Javascript; and PHP, using libraires such as WordPress; Laravel; and jQuery, and utilizing tools such as Gulp; Composer; and iTerm for CLI.</p>

                            <h3>Tann Westlake <small>August 2012 - Present</small></h3>
                            <p>Responsible for building sites for a multitude of varied clients. These are mobile first sites using HTML5 and BEM-style Scss. I build Javascript modules such as sliders; tab systems; and other intereactive elements using the revelaing module pattern.</p>
                            <p>Responsible for configuring and maintaining Apache hosting spaces on shared and bare-bones hosting platforms, as well as deploying sites using tools like FTP, and scp.</p>
                            <p>As the devlopment team grew I implimented processes such as a gulpfile for automating parts of deployment: one task handled compiling and optimising all assets and copying all the deployable files into a new directory ready for upload. This ensured mistakes weren't made during the upload process.</p>
                            <p>I also moved the team over to a Scss based workflow, and built a <a href="https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress-framework">WordPress framework</a> which allows a more MVC style approach to development, useful for larger sites with complex setups and needs.</p>

                            <p>I have carried out small freelance work for various clients over the past few years.</p>
                            <p>Most recently I was contracted to work on part of the front end for the Mad Max game promotional site. My contributions are not live yet, but I can show you a working copy on request.</p>
                            <p>I was responsible for building an interactive map that heavily utilized Javascript for things like sliders, overlays, and tooltips. It also used techniques such as background videos.</p>

I plan to split the <a href="https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress-library/">supporting library</a> into seperate packages that can be used and swapped in/out using an IOC container.</li>
