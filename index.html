                    <h2 class="section__heading">Overview</h2>
                    <p>Full stack developer with three years experience building sites using HTML; Scss; Javascript; and PHP, using libraries such as WordPress; Laravel; and jQuery, and utilizing tools such as Gulp; Composer; and iTerm for CLI.</p>
                    <p>I currently work with front-end technologies mostly, but aim to transition into a purely back-end role.</p>
                    <p>I'm passionate about developing my skillset and eventually working with large teams to create powerful server-side applications.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Tann Westlake <small>August 2012 - Present</small></h3>
                            <p>Responsible for building sites for a multitude of clients, using a mobile first approach, HTML5 and BEM-style Scss. Building Javascript modules such as sliders, tab systems, and other intereactive elements using the revealing module pattern.</p>
                            <p>I work with clients in multiple industries, primarily pharmaceutical and marine, and have built applications that hook into the Google Maps API to help users find medical centers close-by, and other geographical data.</p>
                            <p class="page-break-after">I'm also responsible for configuring and maintaining Apache hosting spaces on shared and bare-bones hosting platforms, as well as deploying sites using tools like FTP, and scp.</p>
                            <p>As the development team grew I implemented processes such as a gulpfile for automating parts of deployment: for example, one task handled compiling and optimising all assets and copying all the deployable files into a new directory ready for upload. This ensured mistakes weren't made during the upload process.</p>
                            <p>I also moved the team over to an Scss based workflow, and built a <a href="https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress-framework">WordPress framework</a> which allows a more MVC style approach to development, useful for larger sites with complex setups and needs.</p>

                            <p>I have carried out small freelance work for various clients over the past few years.</p>
                            <p>Most recently I was contracted to work on part of the front end for the promotional site for the Mad Max game. I was responsible for building an interactive map that heavily utilized Javascript for things like sliders, overlays, and tooltips. It also used techniques such as background videos.</p>
                            <p>My contributions are not live yet, but I can show you a working copy on request.</p>

                        <li><a href="https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress-framework">UltraPress</a>, a WordPress framework I created (and continue to improve) in order to better manage large Wordpress projects. I plan to split the <a href="https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress-library/">supporting library</a> into seperate packages that can be used and swapped in/out using an IOC container.</li>
