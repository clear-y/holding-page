                        <h3>Mediatonic Games <small>Jan 2017 - Present</small></h3>
                        <p>Part of a large team of dedicated C# engineers responsible for implimenting features on a range of primarily mobile focused games that attract millions of monthly players.</p>
                        <p>A typical day consists of a morning stand up; time spent reviewing comments on any open PRs; and feature work, mostly involving server-side C# but also including some Angular.js based admin functionality.</p>
                        <p>As part of this position I have become familiar with technologies such as Kubernetes; Docker; and .NET Core. I've also become comfortable working in an entirely Windows based development environment.</p>

                            panel to manaage the various campaigns. I helped manage and prioritise the task backlog in order to ensure we met the tight deadline.</p>

                        <p>As the development team grew I implemented processes to ensure mistakes weren't made during the development and deployment phases, such as a gulpfile for automating tedious build steps.</p>
